# To run this app, you need to have the model saved as 'placement_model.pkl'.
# You can train the model using a script like 'train_model.py' and save it using
# pickle. Make sure to have the necessary libraries installed:
# pip install streamlit pandas numpy scikit-learn
# To run the app, use the command:
# streamlit run app.py
# To train the model, you would typically have a separate script like 'train_model.py'
# that handles the training process and saves the model as 'placement_model.pkl'.
# Note: Ensure that the model is trained with the same features as used in this app.
# The model should be trained on a dataset that includes these features and the target variable.
# The dataset should be preprocessed similarly to how the input data is structured here.
# This app is a simple demonstration of how to use a machine learning model for predictions.
# Make sure to handle exceptions and edge cases in a production environment.
